# FluxCourse

This is the code repository for the SIF and remote sensing sessions at FluxCourse. The materials are prepared by Xi Yang (Department of Env. Sci, University of Virginia). 

The following Jupyter Notebook code will be used in the class:

* LeafSIF.ipynb: study leaf-level SIF emission with the spectra you measured
* UseSIFlvl2.ipynb: processing satellite SIF data
* MODIS_demo.ipynb: Working with ORNL DAAC MODIS fixed site data

A large chunk of the code that processes satellite SIF data (L2_tools.py and UseSIFlvl2.ipynb) are from Christian Frankenberg (https://github.com/cfranken/SIF_tools).
