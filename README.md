# FluxCourse

This is the code repository for the SIF and remote sensing sessions at FluxCourse. The materials are prepared by Xi Yang (Department of Env. Sci, University of Virginia). 

A large chunk of the code that processes satellite SIF data is from Christian Frankenberg (https://github.com/cfranken/SIF_tools).
