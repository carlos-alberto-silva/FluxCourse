    "In this section, we will learn the basics of SIF emission from leaves, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the shape of fluorescence emission (using the data you collected)\n",
    "* Understand that light intensity as the major control of SIF emission\n",
    "* Retrieve SIF from an outdoor environment\n",
    "\n",
    "What we learn here is a mini-version of what has been down with satellite, airborne, or ground-based remote sensing instruments. Hopefully with this hands-on practice you will gain some basic understandings of remote sensing data processing.\n",

    "## Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to collect the raw digital number from the \"SIF magic box\" experiment. We will convert these DN to radiance. You will need the following packages. Remember to install the packages using \"conda install [package-name]\" in your command line:\n",
