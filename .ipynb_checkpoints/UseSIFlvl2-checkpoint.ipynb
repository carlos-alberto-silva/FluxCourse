    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this section, we will learn how to process SIF data from multiple satellite platforms. At the end of this section, we will compare satellite SIF data with GPP estimation from a few FLUXNET towers. We will go through the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The start: how to read SIF data?\n",
    "* Post-processing: how to create scientifically useful datasets and visualize them?\n",
    "* I want to create fancy maps, how to do it?\n",
    "* Do what we see from the satellite agree with what we see from the ground (i.e. FLUXNET or Ameriflux)?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics\n",
    "We use Jupyter Notebook for this practice. Remember to install the packages using \"conda install [package-name]\" in your command line. Before the course, remember to update your conda (if you use anaconda) by \"conda update conda\".\n",
    "You will need the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* matplotlib\n",
    "* numpy\n",
    "* scipy\n",
    "* h5py\n",
    "* netCDF4\n",
    "* glob\n",
    "* traceback\n",
    "\n",
    "A large portion of this code is from **Christian Frankenberg and Philipp Koehler**. L2_tools.py provides the tools to use TROPOMI and OCO-2 L2 data. You will need to have the following files under the same folder of this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* L2_tools.py: read SIF data; calculate running mean\n",
    "* spectral_shape.dat: the spectral shape you created from the previous section\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful tool to read netCDF file is Panoply. It is a free software from NASA. Download it from here: https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/"
